### Creational patterns

#### Factory method

Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.  

### Structural patterns

#### Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.  

### Behavioral patterns

#### Strategy

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.  

#### Observer

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
